## üîç Overview

The **Enterprise Red Teaming Suite** is a **modular, enterprise-grade offensive security framework** designed for red team engagements in **large-scale corporate environments**. It automates key attack phases such as:

- Reconnaissance
- Initial Access
- Lateral Movement
- Privilege Escalation
- Persistence
- Exfiltration (optional modules)

This toolkit is **battle-tested in simulated enterprise environments**, focusing on stealth, scalability, and modular customization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Automated Recon:** Network & asset discovery across segmented networks.
- **Credential Harvesting:** Custom phishing modules and on-network sniffers.
- **Lateral Movement:** SMB, WMI, PS Remoting, and custom SSH tunnels.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Kernel exploits, token impersonation, and DLL hijacking.
- **Operational Security:** Traffic obfuscation, sandbox evasion, and C2 channel encryption.
- **Modular Design:** Easily integrate new exploits and movement techniques.
